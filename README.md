# Proposal

For our Unit 2 Project we've decided to go with a brute force password cracker. We would like the password cracker to be able to return a saved password from a stored SQL database. We will also have a password saver to help store the passwords for our password cracker.

# Monday

Today we will focus on our ideas for the second unit project. We decided on creating a brute force password cracker. We will research about password crackers and Guis on the internet.

# Tuesday

We will make a password saver, saving passwords into a SQL database. Start working on a Gui for the password saver. We will also work with how the Gui will get the information and store it into the database.

# Wednesday

We will make a passsword cracker, we would like for the password cracker to return a saved password from a SQL database. We will work on the GUI for the password cracker, we woud like the Gui to be functional and successful at finding the saved passwords. 

# Thursday

We will focus on running the code, trying to find bugs and errors. After that, we will use the cracker to try and find a password that is stored into the database. 

# Friday

Present our project.
