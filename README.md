## Tuesday - Thursday Goals

### Tuesday

We will make an account saver, saving accounts into a SQL database. Start working on a Gui for Account saver. We will also work with how the Gui will get the information and store it into the database. Charles will work on the SQL database and putting the saved accounts into the data base, while Jeremiah will work on the Gui.

### Wednesday

We will make a login function, we would like for the Account saver to return a saved account from a SQL database. If we have time, we woud like the Gui to be functional and successful at finding the saved accounts. Charles will work on the SQL database and putting the saved accounts into the database while Jeremiah will work on making sure the account information given by the user is stored into the database. 

### Thursday

We will focus on running the code, trying to find bugs and errors. After that, we will save an account or two into the database. Charles will work on the bugs while Jeremiah will work on seeing if multiple accounts can get saved and can login.
