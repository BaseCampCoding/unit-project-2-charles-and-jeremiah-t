# Project Proposal
## Password cracker

### Description and Motivation
In this project we would like to build a program that can guess the correct password. We will build a password saver to be able to have passwords to crack. Each program will have its own Gui. We wanted to make a password cracker for ethical hacking. Jeremiah and I are interested in ethical hacking.

### Prior Art
Prior arts would be, Hashcat, John the Ripper, Brutus, Wfuzz, etc.. Our project would work like these but we are going to use a brute force password cracker.

### Core User Workflows
- Will Welcome the user.

- Gives the user the choice of saving passwords or cracking them.

- if they choose save they can save a password

- if they choose crack it will cracked saved passwords.


## Tuesday - Thursday Goals

### Tuesday

We will make a password saver, saving passwords into a SQL database. Start working on a Gui for the password saver. We will also work with how the Gui will get the information and store it into the database.

### Wednesday

We will make a passsword cracker, we would like for the password cracker to return a saved password from a SQL database. We will work on the GUI for the password cracker, we woud like the Gui to be functional and successful at finding the saved passwords. 

### Thursday

We will focus on running the code, trying to find bugs and errors. After that, we will use the cracker to try and find a password that is stored into the database. 

### How will you use the content from this unit?


- we plan to use SQL to save passwords

- we plan to use sets, tuples, and dictonaries.

- we plan on using classes and OOP
