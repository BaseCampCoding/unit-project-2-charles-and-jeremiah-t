# Project Proposal
## Password cracker

### Description and Motivation
In this project we would like to build a program that can guess the correct password. We will build a password saver to be able to have passwords to crack. Each program will have its own Gui. We wanted to make a password cracker for ethical hacking. Jeremiah and I are interested in ethical hacking.

### Prior Art
Prior arts would be, Hashcat, John the Ripper, Brutus, Wfuzz, etc.. Our project would work like these but we are going to use a brute force password cracker.

### Core User Workflows
- Will Welcome the user.

- Gives the user the choice of saving passwords or cracking them.

- if they choose save they can save a password

- if they choose crack it will cracked saved passwords.


## Tuesday - Thursday Goals

### Tuesday

We will make a password saver, saving passwords into a SQL database. Start working on a Gui for the password saver. We will also work with how the Gui will get the information and store it into the database. Charles will work on the SQL database and putting the saved passwords into the data base, while Jeremiah will work on the 

### Wednesday

We will make a passsword cracker, we would like for the password cracker to return a saved password from a SQL database. If we have time,  we will work on the GUI for the password cracker, we woud like the Gui to be functional and successful at finding the saved passwords. Charles will work on the SQL database and putting the saved passwords into the database while Jeremiah will work on making sure the password information given by the user is stored into the database. 

### Thursday

We will focus on running the code, trying to find bugs and errors. After that, we will use the cracker to try and find a password that is stored into the database. Charles will work on the bugs while Jeremiah will work on the cracker trying to find a valid password in the database and have the cracker use it to gain access. 

### How will you use the content from this unit?


- we plan to use SQL to save passwords

- we plan to use sets, tuples, and dictonaries.

- we plan on using classes and OOP
